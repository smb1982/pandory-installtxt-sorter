# Pandory Installtxt Sorter
This tool will take your ':\\mcgames\\install.txt' and read in all the xml titles underneath it, then it will sort the romlist by the actual title so that the resulting menu is alphabetical.  Your existing 'install.txt' will be backed up to 'install.bak_$rand' and the new install.txt in its place :)

# How to use
Run 'Pandory Installtxt Sorter.exe' use the file dialog to choose your install.txt on your finished usb stick/directory and wait for it to finish.

# Revert
Next to your new 'install.txt' will be a 'install.bak_$rand', just delete 'install.txt' and rename 'install.bak_$rand' back to 'install.txt'.
